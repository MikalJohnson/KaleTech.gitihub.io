        <h2>Who Am I</h2>
        <p style="line-height:2.5em;">"Hello, I'm Mikal Johnson, a passionate Full Stack Web Developer hailing from the vibrant state of Florida. As an African American, I take pride in my heritage and use it as a source of inspiration in my work. I am also a proud veteran, having served 8 years in the US Army.

            My journey in the world of web development has been nothing short of remarkable. While pursuing my education, I faced significant challenges, including a period of homelessness. Despite these obstacles, my determination and love for coding fueled my ambition to succeed.

            With a focus on Python development, I have honed my skills in crafting dynamic and user-friendly web applications. I possess a solid understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies, allowing me to create seamless experiences for users.

            My portfolio showcases a diverse range of projects, each demonstrating my ability to tackle complex problems and deliver innovative solutions. From intuitive e-commerce platforms to engaging social media applications, I strive to bring ideas to life through clean code and attention to detail.

            Beyond coding, I am a firm believer in the power of teamwork and collaboration. I thrive in an environment where ideas are shared freely, fostering creativity and growth. I am always eager to learn new technologies and stay up-to-date with industry trends.

            In addition to my technical expertise, I am deeply passionate about web development. The ability to transform ideas into functional and visually appealing websites excites me, and I am dedicated to continuously improving my skills to provide the best solutions possible.

            I am currently seeking opportunities to contribute my skills and experience to innovative projects and dynamic teams. I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and organizations who value creativity, diversity, and a shared passion for development."
